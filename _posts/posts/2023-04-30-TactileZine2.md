# Introduction: What is Tactile Zine 2.0?

A physical zine covering the maker and creative culture around custom mechanical keyboards. And anything adjacent. You can expect interviews with community members, commentenary from me, and other related topics. I am also running a blog as well though so I may cross-post snippets of interviews and will be writing other things. This is a revival of my original zine project.

What's a zine? It's a physical, printed on paper, mini magazine that I am self publishing. And to keep the original vibe of the zine, this entire project is DIY. I taught myself how to self host the website. I made the stamps for the thank you notes. I write and edit everything myself. I'm going to try and work on as much art myself as I can. This is a passion project and as such, things can take some time. 

That's not to say I don't want to work with others so if you have an idea, want to contribute, or provide some feedback, please let me know. I also want to hire some of the amazing artists I've seen in the community to provide art for the zines or stickers.

## What happened to Tactile Zine 1.0?
Nothing malicious happened. I lost interest and wanted to get into other things. [Check out the original thread on the geekhack forums](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=70769.0). I took a 6 year break and I'm interested in mechanical keyboards again so I'm back.

&nbsp;

## Where can I buy a zine?
Like Tactile Zine 1.0, the zine will be physical only. I cannot offer the zine for free like I did for 1.0 but I plan on keeping the zine as affordable as possible. 

When they're available, I'll post an update on Instagram, the blog, and on the geekhack thread. They'll be available at https://tactilezine.bigcartel.com/. If there's nothing up or you can't access the site, there's nothing for sale at the moment. Check back whenever you see an announcement from me.

## How can I support you besides buying the zines
If you feel this way, I'm truly thankful. You can donate at https://ko-fi.com/tactilezine. Please don't feel obligated. Your donations will help with things such as stamps, stickers, envelopes, printing costs, and other supplies.

&nbsp;

## On Shipping
In an effort to keep this zine as affordable as possible, I will only ship zines via letter mail. Letter mail means it's mail where you put paper in an envelope and put a stamp on it like your parents/grandparents might have done. 

USPS offers a choice of 2 stamps:

1) For US domestic shipping - USPS first-class forever stamps ([link for more information including current pricing](https://www.usps.com/ship/first-class-mail.htm))
2) For US to all non-US international shipping - USPS global forever stamp ([link for more information including current pricing](https://www.usps.com/international/first-class-mail-international.htm))

Yes this means that you will be paying approximately $0.63 - $1.45 USD for shipping. This also means there is *no* tracking number. I will also be subject to [any current service restrictions](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/service-alerts/international/welcome.htm) that USPS has.

I have shipped hundreds of zines when I was shipping Tactile Zine 1.0 and there were only a few lost zines. I am currently not willing to add any other shipment methods. Also as I said previously, I want to keep this as affordable as possible. Please keep this in mind when ordering.

If you do not receive your zine in a reasonable amount of time (~1 month), please contact me.

## What's coming next?
Currently I'm working on editing the interviews I have for the next time. That will hopefully be on soonTM. I do also have an idea for a second zine as well so that will be worked on as soon as I am finished with the other.

I have been posting a few things on [my blog](https://tactilezine.xyz/posts) and will continue doing so. I am interested in doing some new to me switch reviews (lol everything is new to me). I just made my first purchases on Switch Oddities and Keyleido. 

I will be attending at least 2 meetups this summer (in Connecticut and the CannonKeys meetup). I have talked to a few people who have asked if I would reprint the 1.0 zines. My intent for those was to stay print only. However, I realize there's lots of new people who may have found the project later and wasn't able to read them. I will be bringing the 1.0 zines to the meetups so people can browse them. So I hope to see you at the meetups. I am hoping to attend more as well and will try to make the effort of bringing the 1.0 zines for people to check out. I also hope to have 2.0 zines and stickers for sale at any meetups I go to.

Please look forward to what's coming next!
