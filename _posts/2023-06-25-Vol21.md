If you've ever wondered what got me back into keyboards after 6 years away, it's pretty simple. I was at a point in my life when I had a lot of free time and got sucked into the vtuber fandom. Between the streams I liked and still keeping up with technology, I was on YouTube pretty often. I would see recommendations for videos from Linus Tech Tips or keyboard typing samples which would remind me of the hobby. But I really remember watching the Hololive Indonesia vtuber Pavolia Reine's stream when she reviewed her fans' keyboards.

Also IRyS talked a lot about her love for Mode and keyboards in general. I was so surprised that my little niche hobby that I was into years ago was suddenly being talked about in so many places. But surely the hobby was still small right? I thought nothing much changed since 2017...and so I started casualty looking at keyboards again. Obviously a lot has changed so I have a lot to learn again. I figured this would be a nice time to restart my Tactile Zine series as I dive back into my old hobby.

Volume 2.1 is the first in this revival series. In this volume, I talked to HoffmanMyster, LightningXI, and ThereminGoat. I wanted to speak to people who have a lot of time in the hobby and are still involved. If you don't know these people, HoffmanMyster is an old friend of mine who has been a long time community member and now Drop employee. LightningXI is a Twitch streamer who builds a lot of keyboards including boards that are coming out for sale. And ThereminGoat writes your favorite switch reviews on his site.

The first sales will be at the [Glastonbury CT NEKB Meetup - Coffee and Keyboards at RaonJena on 7/8](https://tactilezine.bigcartel.com). An online sale will follow with information to come. And I will have these zines for sale going forward on my site as well as at any meetups I'm attending.

## I want to buy a zine, where do I go?
I will announce when the online storefront is open and has stock. [Link for the storefront is here.](https://tactilezine.bigcartel.com/)
