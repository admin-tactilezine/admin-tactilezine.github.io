If you've ever wondered what got me back into keyboards after 6 years away, it's pretty simple. I was at a point in my life when I had a lot of free time and got sucked into the vtuber fandom. Between the streams I liked and still keeping up with technology, I was on YouTube pretty often. I would see recommendations for videos from Linus Tech Tips or keyboard typing samples which would remind me of the hobby. But the moment that I really remember is when Hololive Indonesia vtuber Pavolia Reine did a stream reviewing her fans' keyboards.

Also IRyS talked a lot about her love for Mode and keyboards in general. I was so surprised that my little niche hobby that I was into years ago was suddenly being talked about in so many places. But surely the hobby was still small right? I thought nothing much changed since 2017...so I casually started looking into keyboards again. Obviously a lot has changed so I have a lot to learn again. Since I'm doing all this research, I figured this would be a nice time to restart my Tactile Zine series as I dive back into the hobby.

Volume 2.1 is the first in this revival zine series. In this volume, I talked to HoffmanMyster, LightningXI, and ThereminGoat. I wanted to speak to people who have a lot of time in the hobby and are still involved. In case you're not familiar with these people and need an introduction:

HoffmanMyster is an old friend of mine who has been a long time community member and now Drop employee. LightningXI is a Twitch streamer who builds a lot of keyboards and the owner of the best keyboard community. And ThereminGoat writes your favorite switch reviews on his site.

## I want to buy a zine, where do I go?
The first sale of the zines will be at the [Glastonbury CT NEKB Meetup - Coffee and Keyboards at RaonJena on 7/8/23](https://tactilezine.bigcartel.com). An online sale will follow soon in July 2023 with information to come. And I will have these zines for sale going forward on my site as well as at any meetups I'm attending. I will announce when the online storefront is open and has stock. [Link for the storefront is here.](https://tactilezine.bigcartel.com/)
