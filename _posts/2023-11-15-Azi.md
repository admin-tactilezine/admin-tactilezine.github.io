# Annoucing a collab with Azi Keycaps
For the December 2023 NYC meetup, I wanted to do something special and bring some more artisan representation. I'm pleased to announce that [Azi Keycaps](https://www.instagram.com/azi.keycaps/) and I are doing a collab. These Pato Puto caps will be available at the NYC meetup in a bundle with a special Volume 2.3 zine. This colorway was inspired by an old New York Islanders logo I found and by all the New York sports team colors. Thank you very much to ej6 of Azi Keycaps for agreeing to do this project with me.

In addition, aqlno, the creator of the amazing [hot dog artwork from That Windy City Keeb Meetup 2023](https://chicagomechkb.xyz/That-Windy-City-Keebmeet-2023-d03e41cfd4ee4a7a91f76b49d9872880), created an amazing sticker design for this collab. Thank you so much aqlno for the slightly threatening duck! You can see the design in the bottom left of the zine cover but this will also be a sticker included in the bundle.

## Sale Info
