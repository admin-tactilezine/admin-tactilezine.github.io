<h1> About </h1>

This is the new home of Tactile. It was a project that lived on geekhack and focused on keyboard and the DIY culture surrounding it. That project and zine will be revived and live here. But also it'll just serve as a vehicle for me to do whatever I feel like. Hope you enjoy.

You can expect to see things related to photography (especially film), mechanical keyboards, video games, and printmaking. Among other things...maybe. And with a focus on DIY.
