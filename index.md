<h1> About </h1>

This atelier is Tactile Zine Creative Works. This grew out of the original project: Tactile Zine. It was a project that lived on geekhack and focused on keyboard and the DIY culture surrounding it. That project and zine will be revived and live here. But also it'll just serve as a vehicle for me to do whatever I feel like creatively. Hope you enjoy.

You can expect to see things related to zine making, mechanical keyboards, photography (especially film), video games, and printmaking. Among other things...maybe. And with a focus on DIY.
